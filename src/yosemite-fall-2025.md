If staying at backpacker sites near Fletcher Lake, please disperse several hundred feet from the campground boundary when going to the bathroom. Fires are prohibited in the Vogelsang area, at Boothe Lake, and above 9,600 feet. Along the Tuolumne Watershed, ensure all washing and waste is 300' from water.

> * an offline copy of this doc
> * the Recreation.gov app, (with her login or mine?)
> * onX with our Yosemite trip downloaded into "off-line maps" Not sure if she can use my account, or she should just pay for a year, and when I see she I mean me :-)

Certain bear-resistant portable containers designed for backpackers to store food are allowed for use in Yosemite (however, only the Garcia Backpackers' Cache 812 is available for rental in Yosemite).

### Estimating How Much Fuel

For more detail see [this REI Expert Advice article](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/how-much-stove-fuel-should-i-take-on-my-backpacking-trip.html)

To get a ballpark estimate I am going to count the boils needed. For example, for breakfast I will need two boils, one for coffee and one for oats.  For dinner I will also need two boils one for food hydration and a second for cooking time.

>Assume: 4 boils per person per day (`4b`)

For fuel I plan to use the small 100g cans.  According to the REI article noted above you can get ~12 boils. I am going to round that down to 10 to be safe.

>Assume: 10 boils per can (`10pbd`)

Doing the math for two people (`2p`) and five days (`5d`), the two stays in the backpacker's camp count as a half day. So that is 4 full days and two half days for a total of five days.

```eq
number of cans = (2p * 5d * 4b) / 10bpd = 4
```

> We need `4` 100g cans
