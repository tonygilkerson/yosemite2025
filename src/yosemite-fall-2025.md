# Yosemite Fall 2025

Me and LT are doing it!

![Rafferty Creek->Vogelsang](img/Yosemite-Rafferty-Creek-Vogelsang.png)

## Workflow

The workflow here is a simple top-down approach. Start with our questions, make and complete our to-do lists, finalize our plan then have fun on our trip!

* **Q&A Page** – Use this as a scratch pad for questions, ideas, and partially formed thoughts. Once a question is answered, move the information to either the Lists Page or the Plan Page and remove it from here.
* **Lists Page** – Contains various to-do lists to help organize and prepare for the trip. These lists are for planning and preparation only; they are not needed during the trip itself.
* **Plan Page** – Provides a clear, step-by-step timeline of our trip.
* **Trip Site** – An offline copy of the Plan Page, along with additional reference materials we might need in case of emergencies (such as a PDF map of the park, ranger station phone numbers, reservation numbers, etc.). Most of this supplementary material is for backup and should only be needed if something unexpected comes up.

>This [Notion Page](https://www.notion.so/Yosemite-220de104b4ac817da062caf2a1ad77f1?source=copy_link) contains the Q&A, Lists and Plan pages.

>The [Trip Site](https://tonygilkerson.github.io/yosemite2025/) contains a readonly copy of the Plan and supplementary material to be made available off-line

## The Plan

**TODO** - When the plan is finalize on the Notion page it will be copied here for off-line access. The info needs copied to the Plan Page to be refined and finalized

### Dates

| Date         | Camp Area                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Sep 22, 2025 | Vogelsang High Sierra Camp   |
| Sep 23, 2025 | Merced Lake High Sierra Camp |
| Sep 24, 2025 | Sunrise High Sierra Camp     |

This is our official itinerary, but if we want to make changes we can!

>We start from `Rafferty Creek->Vogelsang`, this trail follows the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne River through sub-alpine meadows and then climbs along Rafferty Creek to Tuolumne Pass, Vogelsang, and destinations beyond!

Travel at least four miles from Tuolumne Meadows before finding allowable camping. There is no longer a toilet at the backpacker sites at Vogelsang. If staying at backpacker sites near Fletcher Lake, please disperse several hundred feet from the campground boundary when going to the bathroom. Fires are prohibited in the Vogelsang area, at Boothe Lake, and above 9,600 feet. Along the Tuolumne Watershed, ensure all washing and waste is 300' from water.

Half Dome available with this trailhead. All members of the permit are eligible to walk up Half Dome. Additional fees of $10 per person due when permit is issued.

## Supplementary Material

I need to go through the material below and add to the Notion Pages. I just started this before we had the Notion page.

### Reservation - Rafferty Creek to Vogelsang

* [Reservation #0745333876-1](https://www.recreation.gov/account/orders/0745333876/reservations/7c8009d3-0cb3-4171-9fe2-d2b658c97ffb__445859)

> **TODO** - LT needs to prep here iPhone as a backup. She will need:
> * an offline copy of this doc
> * the Recreation.gov app, (with her login or mine?)
> * onX with our Yosemite trip downloaded into "off-line maps" Not sure if she can use my account, or she should just pay for a year, and when I see she I mean me :-)

### Permit Pickup

You must pick up your permit in person at any open [Yosemite Wilderness Permit Station](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/permitstations.htm) (stations open seasonally, not limited to your listed issuing station) the day before, or the day of your permit entry date. You must pick up your permit by 11:00 a.m. on your entry date or place it on hold for late pick-up, or it will be cancelled. To place your permit on hold, log in to your recreation.gov account to modify your permit reservation and mark it for late pick-up once you are within one week of your entry date.

* **Tuolumne Meadows Wilderness Center** - is located just off the Tioga Road in Tuolumne Meadows. It is about one mile east of the visitor center. From the Tioga Road, follow signs for Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, Dog Lake, and Wilderness Permits. Parking is available at the wilderness center.
* **Coordinates**: 37.87695, -119.34626

> **TODO** - Need to figure out if it is possible to stay at any of the Backpackers Campgrounds. We could pickup our passes the day before in the Valley, be a tourist for the day, then spend the night in the Backpackers Campground in the Valley.  In the morning we would have a drive but that should be ok given we have our passes? Or be tourists for the day and drive to Tuolume Meadows in the evening and stay there so we ge an early start.

### Food Storage

Bear-Resistant Food Storage is required for all overnight stays in Yosemite Wilderness. Bear canisters are available for rent at a Yosemite Wilderness Permit Station for $5 per week (deposit required).

Certain bear-resistant portable containers designed for backpackers to store food are allowed for use in Yosemite (however, only the Garcia Backpackers' Cache 812 is available for rental in Yosemite).  

* See [allowed containers](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/containers.htm)

### Current Conditions

Before you go Check [Current Wilderness Conditions](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildcond.htm) for trail conditions and timely updates, and reead the [Yosemite Backpacking page](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/backpacking.htm).

### Public Transportation

Explore Public Transportation Options for going to and getting around Yosemite National Park.

* [YARTS](https://www.yarts.com/) - For inside the park
* [Public Transportation](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/publictransportation.htm) - Such as Amtrak and Greyhound if we want to travel from one of the surrounding areas.

### Backpackers Campgrounds

[Backpackers campgrounds](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/bpcamp.htm) (open seasonally) are available for wilderness permit holders to spend one night before and one night after a wilderness trip. **Reservations are not required nor necessary**.

The fee is $8 per person. Download the **Recreation.gov mobile app** now and use the *Scan & Pay* feature onsite (even if you don't have internet access at the campground). Parking is not available at campgrounds; instead park at designated overnight parking areas and walk to the backpackers campground.

> **TODO** Need to figure out which Backpackers Campgrounds we are staying in, Tuolumne Medows or the Valley.

#### Yosemite Valley

This campground has vault toilets and no potable water (potable water is available nearby in North Pines Campground).

While you may park for 15 minutes at the entrance to the backpackers campground (in North Pines Campground) to unload your gear, park overnight at the trailhead parking or at Curry Village parking. (Overnight parking is not available at The Ahwahnee.)

#### Tuolumne Meadows

[Tuolumne Meadows Campground](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tmcamp.htm)'s major rehabilitation project is nearly complete; the campground is planned to reopen in 2025 (eta Aug??). Each campsite is near a bathroom with drinking water and flushing toilets. The group sites have five food lockers. See [Opening, Closing, and Reservation Updates](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm#updates) for last minute deets, or call the Tuolumne Meadows campground office at (209) 372-4025.

If you are hiking through Tuolumne Meadows, you must camp at least four trail miles from Tuolumne Meadows.

>If you are starting or ending a wilderness trip from Tuolumne Meaows, you can use any **other open backpackers campground**.
