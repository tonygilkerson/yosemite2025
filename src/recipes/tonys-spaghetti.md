# Tonys Spaghetti

I made this one up :-)

## Ingredients

* 60 grams dehydrated cut spaghetti
* 45 grams dehydrated Traditional Pasta Sauce (the one with no oil)
* 2 grams dehydrated chopped mushrooms
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp italian seasoning
* 1 Tbsp olive oil pack
* 3 Tbsp romano cheese pack

## Notes

* **Spaghetti** - Can use regular long spaghetti but I find the cut pasta works better in the vacuum bags and is easier to eat with a spoon from a meal pouch.

* **Mushrooms** - Remove stem and cut into small pieces to aid in the hydration process

* **Package** - Combine dry ingredients and the two small oil and cheese packs into one vacuum bag

## Method

* **Unpack** - Pour dry ingredients from two packs into pot, set aside the oil and cheese packs.

* **Heat Water** - Heat water using the Jetboil or a second pot. If you don't have a second pot, cold water works but hot water gives better results.

* **Add Water** - Pour hot water into pot until it just covers the dry ingredients plus a little extra.

* **Hydrate 15 min** - Stir well to combine and place pot in a cozy then set aside to let the dry ingredients hydrate for **15 min**. Add more water if needed to keep the ingredients covered and well-saturated.

* **Simmer 5 min** - Set stove to medium flame and bring the hydrating mix to a boil, stirring frequently to mix. Once it boils, reduce the heat to a low simmer for 5 min.

* **Steep 10 min** - Place pot in a cozy and set aside for to hydrate and steam for 10 min more for flavors to blend and ingredients to fully reconstitute.

* **Serve** - Pour into meal pouch, drizzle oil on top and mix. Finally, sprinkle on the cheese and enjoy!
