So that is 4 full days and two half days for a total of five days.</p> <pre><code>number of cans = (2p * 5d * 4b) / 10bpd = 4\n</code></pre> <p>We need <code>4</code> 100g cans</p>"},{"location":"yosemite-fall-2025/#need-to-get","title":"Need to Get","text":"<ul> <li>First day breakfast + lunch: <ul> <li>bread</li> <li>(2) mini bags of chips</li> <li>(2) bananas</li> <li>cheese</li> <li>veggie meat</li> <li>PB</li> <li>Jelly</li> </ul> </li> <li>Oatmeal add-ins: cranberries + PB? </li> <li>Lunch protein/Main:<ul> <li>tuna creations (lauren only)</li> <li>chicken creations  (lauren only)</li> <li>PB &amp; J</li> </ul> </li> <li>Lunch crispies/crackers:<ul> <li>goldfish</li> <li>cheeze-its</li> <li>other crackers??</li> </ul> </li> <li>Condiments?: mustard + mayo packets</li> <li>Drinks: Electrolytes, Hot cocoa, tea</li> <li>Snacks: (options below - won\u2019t bring everything...obviously)<ul> <li>Trail mix (work)</li> <li>Protein bars (work)</li> <li>Stinger waffles?</li> <li>Running gummies/salt pills?</li> <li>Dried fruit?</li> <li>Chocolate?</li> </ul> </li> <li>One dessert? :)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"yosemite-fall-2025/#search-and-rescue-insurance","title":"Search and Rescue Insurance","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Learn About Your Plan - Visit the Support Center to browse resources including articles, videos, owner's manuals and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Contact Garman - For questions regarding SAR plans, contact the Customer Service &amp; Billing Team at <code>1-888-460-4554</code> or <code>plan-support@garmin.com</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document - SAR Insurance Documents</p> </li> </ul> <p>Plan Details</p> <pre><code>Plan name: SAR 100 Search and Rescue Insurance Plan\nAccount number: DL3296962\nPlan term: 12 months\nStart date: 9/11/2025\nAnnual plan fee: $39.95 USD\nInsured individual: Anthony Gilkerson\nBeneficiary: Teresa Gilkerson\nRenewal date: 9/11/2026.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"yosemite-fall-2025/#visitor-centers-museums","title":"Visitor Centers &amp; Museums","text":"<p>Visitor center and museums in the Yosemite Valley</p> <ul> <li> <p>Yosemite Valley Welcome Center (located next to Village Store, open all year): Ranger-staffed information desk and bookstore, informational and directional exhibits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Yosemite Exploration Center, formerly Valley Visitor Center (opening Fall 2023): Spirit of Yosemite film, and exhibit areas detailing the park's geology, plant and animal life, history, rock climbing, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Yosemite Museum (open all year): The Indian Cultural Exhibit and Village interprets the cultural history of Yosemite's traditionally associated tribes from 1850 to the present.
